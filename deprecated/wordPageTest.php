Oh, caught in a bad romance

Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma

Want your bad romance

Want your bad romancej

I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love

I want your drama, the touch of your hand
I want your leather studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
(Love, love, love, I want your love)

You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, bad romance

I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and all your love is revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance

Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

I wanna kiss you
But if I do then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A love game, a love game

Hold me and love me
Just want touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds is in it for my heart to quit it

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? Dans le LoveGame.
I wanna hold em like they do in Texas Plays
Fold em let em hit me raise it baby stay with me, I love it
Luck and intuition play the cards with Spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me, I love it
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love if it's not rough it isn't fun, fun

Oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you see, see
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

(K-kinda busy) K-kinda busy
(K-kinda busy) K-kinda busy
(K-kinda busy) Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You shoulda made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Huh!

I wanna kiss you
But if I do then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A love game, a love game

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love, or you want fame
Are you in the game?
Dans the love game (French; literally \"In the love game\")
Let's play a love game, play a love game

We are the crowd
We're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you
It's so magical
We'd be so fantastico

Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Your Papa-Paparazzi 

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine 
Baby, you'll be famous

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous

I feel good, I walk along
But then I trip upon myself and I fall, I
I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit
That makes me want to scream

So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body

Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was redLoving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song


I was reminiscing just the other day,
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light, go,
Hey, skip the conversation and you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke weâ€™d made,
And that was the first day.

And darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
