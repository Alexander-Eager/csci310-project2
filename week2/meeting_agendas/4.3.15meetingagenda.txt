Meeting Agenda 4/3

Eric
1) Eric Wang worked with Alex Eager in a pair programming fashion to figure out which API to pull articles from, and wrote the PHP script to pull these articles from Google Scholar
2) While working with Alex, we initially attempted to pull from IEEE and ACM, neither of which provided efficient ways to pull articles 
3) Eric will be working on the documentation, as well as ensuring that he fulfills his role as Scrum Master, and makes sure that everybody stays on task. 

Ryan
1) Ryan developed the test cases, then he edited them per the lectures slides.
2) Ryan had some issues with developing the outputs of the test cases
3) Ryan will be working on finalizing the black test cases

Eric T
1) Eric Tang has done refactoring the lyricsfloat word cloud generator code and make a new word cloud class.
2) Don’t know some minor design details for implementation.
3) Eric Tang will be working on integrating codes.

Alex
1) Alex has almost finished setting up the virtual machine so that the group can all work in a uniform environment for testing and implementation. He also worked with Eric Wang in pair programming to nearly complete the search functionality since 4/1. We ended up using Google Scholar instead of IEEE or ACM. 
2) Alex still has to figure out testing with Ryan, and debating the exact way to write the test cases is challenging. Luckily, Eric Tang has working shell scripts for coverage metrics and one-command test case running.
3) By the next meeting Alex is expected to have made the search code more structured and executable.

May 
1) Since the last meeting, May has documented the past two meetings.
2) May has had issues with the logo and how it might affect future pages due to its sizing.
3) May will be working on the framework of the project’s search page and a project logo by the next meeting. She will also be documenting this current meeting.
