1) I researched regular expressions to facilitate future coding practices.
2) It might take a bit longer to finish the UI features.
3) I will continue working on the UI features and I will help Alex with test cases

Kevin
1) I learned additional methods of sorting tables by frequency of an object inside the table
2) I am currently working on data storage of article word frequency
3) I will continue to implement the frequency feature for the generation of the article table

Alex
1) I helped the group figure out what to do for this sprint.
2) I was not able to attend the last meeting due to class conflict, so Iâ€™ve fallen a bit behind on the group activities.  I have mostly caught up by now, though.
3) I will try to get word frequency working.
