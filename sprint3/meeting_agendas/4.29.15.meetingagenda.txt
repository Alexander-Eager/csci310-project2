Meeting 4/29

May Wu
I have been helping Eric T out with the Articles.php UI.
I have had technical difficulties regarding my laptop failing to work at full speed. Might need to rent laptops to use instead.
I will also work on Eric Tâ€™s branch to fix errors in the code.

Alex Eager
I have been working on adding word frequency to the table of articles.
I have to change a lot of test cases to reflect the added functionality, which just takes time. There is also the matter of making a table for a given conference, which I have to hash out with Eric Tang, who is working on that.
I should be completely finished with the word frequency functionality and helping out Eric Tang with conference functionality by the next meeting.

Ryan Zhou
I have been working the documentation for the extreme programming practices document
I had some trouble with determining the best way to prove our extreme programming practices
I will have all of the documentation that I am able to do with the group members present done so tomorrow it can be finalized.

Eric Tang
I have been working on UI of article table and adding test cases for WordCloudArray.php
Phpunit test misinterprets  $_GET[] so that the working code can not pass test cases.
I will be working on conference table.
